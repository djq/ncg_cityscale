=============

This describes the workflow for visualization of dublin traffic patterns. There are three pieces associated with this:

 - 1: Routing calculations: user supply start-end address with desired arrival time. The user can then also choose a time range which enables them to observe diferent routes. Summary visualization of different routes shown on screen that user can cycle through
 
 - 2: Area performance: user can use a pre-defined square or draw a polygon to assess the traffic flows in an area

### 1: Routing Patterns



### 2: Area Performance



### 3: Iso-Calculations

Added an image of the iso-calculation here to demonstrate what it looks like:
